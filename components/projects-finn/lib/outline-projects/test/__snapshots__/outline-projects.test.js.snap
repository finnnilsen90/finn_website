                The initial build lasted over a year from its conception and required a strategic approach in order to meet the business goals of the project. The main business goal of the project was to establish a fully automated workflow for our lower budget clients, reducing the need for human touch points. At the same time we were also automating parts of the workflow for our higher budget clients through Hub. The platform was officially launched on February 2019 and resulted in over a million dollars going through the fully automated portion of the platform via credit card payment in its first year.

                I was a Technical Supervisor on the project which meant I was involved with building the taxonomy and organization of data within the DMP. I was also heavily involved with various product decisions around monetizing the DMP. One of the ways we monetized the use of the DMP was by providing advanced reporting for our clients.

                My role on the Pearl team has been to develop code for the Pearl chatbot, and help outline the overall customer interaction with Pearl by working with copywriters. I have both a marketing and technical background which made me the perfect fit for a role that involves understanding user behavior from a data driven perspective, and understanding how a computer program works; so I could best match that user behavior to a chatbot.

                The initial goal of the ChatBot was to act as an assistant on the JustAnswer platform. The ChatBot was programmed to interact with the customer and gather high level information to then pass onto an online expert who would eventually answer the question the customer had. To add further clarity to JustAnswer’s business model. JustAnswer is a platform that allows people to converse with certified online experts.
